# Unofficial Community Patch

A collection of Quality of Life fixes for Hitman III (or Hitman: World of Assassination). This ranges from localisation line break fixes, all the way to model part replacements to fix inverted normals on clothing, and everything in-between. If it's broken in-game, this project aims to fix it!

## Contributing

To contribute a fix, make an issue for it first in this repository, then make a fork (or a branch if you have the right permissions), and then commit your fix to the branch with the title named: `feat: fix this thing`.

Note: **Do not** use the prefix `fix:` in your commit title - your fix is to the game, not to the mod (adding a patch is a _feature_ of the mod, not a fix); `feat:` is for new additions, `fix:` is only to be used if one of the mod's bug fixes didn't work properly and you were resolving that.

Then, make a pull request to this repository. You can then add `Fixes #15` (or whatever the number ID of the issue you created/ are fixing) to the PR description, which will close the issue automatically when your PR is merged.
